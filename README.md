Master - updated as of April 27th, 2017

## Get Started
Go to this link and learn what chaincode is https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode
For chaincode examples visit https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles/tree/v2.0

### Hyperledger v1.0
https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles/tree/v3.0 Here are the example integration with the new Hyperledger v1.0. If you are brave, branch off master and start writing it for the v1.0 server migration.

## Update Chaincode for Giveback
You can create new functions and change the GO code here. The server that runs this repo and pick up the changes and deploy it onto the blockchain service to run. I would advise starting a new server instance to test the newly implemented chaincode before integratin with a production server.
